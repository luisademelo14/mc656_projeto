This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, enter the oportuni directory. Using the Node Package Manager (npm), install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Also, the file `env.local` must contain the `MONGODB_URI` variable, which holds the connection string for a MongoDB database.

To run the application:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

To run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
